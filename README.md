C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

<p>A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.</p>
<p>Big O is an estimate of the worst case performance of a function assuming the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations. Big O is an estimate of the worst case performance of a function assuming the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations</p>
